# K3Y Open Slot Finder

## Project Description

The K3Y Open Slot Finder helps amateur radio operators track available time slots during the [SKCC Straight Key Month](https://www.skccgroup.com/k3y/k3y.php) event.  
The app allows users to select a specific area, time zone, and displays available open slots within a user-defined time range. The app is designed to make it easy to find available slots for the K3Y event, which can be filtered and saved for later use.

## Features

- **Time Zone Selection**: Choose the appropriate time zone.
- **Select K3Y Area**: Filter available slots based on the selected K3Y area.
- **View Available Time Slots**: Check open slots in the event schedule.
- **Download Available Slots**: Export available time slots to a CSV file.
- **Save Settings**: Save the time zone, K3Y area, and start/end time preferences for future use.
